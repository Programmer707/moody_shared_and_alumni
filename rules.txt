Put a folder with your full name in it without spaces
 Don't touch other peoples workspace
 NEVER OVERWRITE
 FIRST GIT PULL THEN GIT PUSH
 if you want to share code using your folder add it to a working directory in your folder
 Finished projects should go in a finished directory
 Please add a txt file with contact information and a little bit about a project if it is not self explanatory.
 Don't discourage others work
 Don't steal complete work and pass it off as your own.
 Copying is allowed but only snippets of code and it needs to be for anther purpose.
 For example you can steal code to make a clock. But you cannot steal a full app.
 Put whatever you want and don't be afraid
